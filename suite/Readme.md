These folders do NOT contain DreamBerd's examples. They just contain all the tests carried out on the current [best DreamBerd implementation](https://github.com/vivaansinghvi07/dreamberd-interpreter/).

You can find the actual examples [here](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd/blob/main/Examples.md) but please only read them after reading all DreamBerd's features.
