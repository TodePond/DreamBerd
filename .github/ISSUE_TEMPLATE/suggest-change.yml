      description: Give an example in the language on how this change would look. Ideally, you'd also provide a comparison to how it looks currently (which would no longer ba valid after this change) and how this would look after this change.
      placeholder: |
        // Currently, the language requires people to do this:
        print(2 + 3)!
        // With this proposed change, this hurtful syntax wouldn't be required anymore.
        // Instead, you'd do this:
        print(2 plus 3)

    id: why
    attributes:
      label: Why should the language do this?
      description: Give a clear but not overly long description on why this feature would be not only worth adding to the language, but also worth breaking existing programs for.
      placeholder: This should be done because of code readability. The `+` operator may not be known to everyone reading the code, and discriminating against certain people is a bad practice. Therefore, we shouldn't even give users the option to do such a hurtful and harmul thing.
