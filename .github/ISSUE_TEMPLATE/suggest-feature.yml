      description: Clearly state what you'd like to see added.
      placeholder: I'd love to see an alias for `+` called `plus` added to the language.

    attributes:
      label: Give an example.
      description: Give an example in the language on how this feature would look. Ideally, you'd also provide a comparison to how it has to be done currently.
      placeholder: |
        // Currently, the language requires people to do this:
        print(2 + 3)!
        // With this proposed change, you'd be able to do this:
        print(2 plus 3)

    attributes:
      label: Why should the language adopt this?
      description: Give a clear but not overly long description on why this feature would be worth adopting to the language.
      placeholder: This should be done because of code readability. The `+` operator may not be known to everyone reading the code, and discriminating against certain people is a bad practice.
