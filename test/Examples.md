## Fake Fake Examples

Did you just skip to the end of the features page? You just SKIMMED it? That means you missed the _real_ examples page.

You should go back and learn all the features properly [here](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd/blob/main/README.md).<br>
After doing that, you can check out the examples page [here](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd/blob/main/res/Examples.md).

_If you found this file by exploring the source code of DreamBerd - e/acc - then please stop. There is nothing to find here, just silly little jokes!_
