# Comp-Trans-Piler
Running a perfect programming language requires a perfect compiler to run it. As such, the DreamBerd foundation has devised the next innovation in the field of compiling. The **Comp-Trans-Piler**.

The Comp-Trans-Piler works by independently compiling DreamBerd while at the same time transpiling it to JavaScript, maximizing efficiency while staying true to DreamBerd.

While the JavaScript compiler is extensive, it forgives barbaric practices such as loops, while at the same time lacking modern features such as Exact Equalities. As such DreamBerd first ensures that the code abides by the DreamBerd standard before passing it to lesser compilers.
