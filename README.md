# DreamBerd
DreamBerd is a perfect programming language. These are its features!<br>
When you've finished reading through all the features, check out the [examples](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd/blob/main/Examples.md).

## Exclamation Marks!
Be bold! End every statement with an exclamation mark!
```c
print("Hello world")!
```

If you're feeling extra-bold, you can use even more!!!
```c
print("Hello world")!!!
```

If you're unsure, that's ok. You can put a question mark at the end of a line instead. It prints debug info about that line to the console for you.
```c
print("Hello world")?
```

You might be wondering what DreamBerd uses for the 'not' operator, which is an exclamation mark in most other languages. That's simple - the 'not' operator is a semi-colon instead.
```c
if (;false) {
    print("Hello world")!
}
```

## Declarations
There are four types of declaration. Constant constants can't be changed in any way.
```java
const const name = "Luke"!
```

Constant variables can be edited, but not re-assigned.
```java
const var name = "Luke"!
name.pop()!
name.pop()!
```

Variable constants can be re-assigned, but not edited.
```java
var const name = "Luke"!
name = "Lu"!
```

Variable variables can be re-assigned and edited.
```java
var var name = "Luke"!
name = "Lu"!
name.push("k")!
name.push("e")!
```

## Naming
Both variables and constants can be named with any Unicode character or string.
```java
const const firstAlphabetLetter = 'A'!
var const üëç = True!
var var 1Ô∏è‚É£ = 1! 
```

This includes numbers, and other language constructs.
```java
const const 5 = 4!
print(2 + 2 === 5)! //true
```

## Arrays
Some languages start arrays at `0`, which can be unintuitive for beginners. Some languages start arrays at `1`, which isn't representative of how the code actually works. DreamBerd does the best of both worlds: Arrays start at `-1`.
```java
const const scores = [3, 2, 5]!
print(scores[-1])! //3
print(scores[0])!  //2
print(scores[1])!  //5
```

**New for 2022!**<br>
You can now use floats for indexes too!
```java
const var scores = [3, 2, 5]!
scores[0.5] = 4
print(scores) //[3, 2, 4, 5]!
```

## When
Mutating variables is **very dangerous** and must be **avoided at all costs**. But in case you really need to vary variables, the `when` keyword lets you check a variable each time it mutates.
```java
const var health = 10!
when (health = 0) {
   print("You lose")!
}
```

## Installation
To install DreamBerd to your command line, first install the DreamBerd installer.<br>
To install the DreamBerd installer, install the DreamBerd installer installer.

**New for 2022!**<br>
Due to the complicated installation process, you can now install the 'Create DreamBerd App' app that installs everything for you!

## Loops
Loops are a complicated relic of archaic programming languages. With DreamBerd, just use the new `return` keyword to 'return' to the previous line.

```js
print("cheep")! //cheep, cheep, cheep...
return!
```

Use more exclamation marks to go back further!!
```js
var const i = 10!
print(i)!
i--!
if (i > 0) return!!
print("Blast off")!
```

If you want to get a value from a function, just `export` it!

```js
function add(a, b) => {
   export a + b!
}
print(add(3, 2)! //5
```

## Booleans
Booleans can be `true`, `false` or `maybe`.
```java
const var keys = {}!
after ("keydown") e => keys[e.key] = true!
after ("keyup") e => keys[e.key] = false!

function isKeyDown(key) => {
   if (keys[key] = undefined) export maybe!
   export keys[key]!
}
```

**Technical info:** Booleans are stored as one-and-a-half bits.

## Conditionals
You can use the `perhaps` keyword for deciding what to do when a condition is `maybe`.
```java
const const isTuesday = maybe!

if (isTuesday) {
   print("It's Tuesday")!
} else {
   print("It's not Tuesday")!
} perhaps {
   print("It's maybe Tuesday")!
}
```

## Indents
When it comes to indentation, DreamBerd strikes a happy medium that can be enjoyed by everyone: All indents must be 3 spaces long.
```java
function main() => {
   print("DreamBerd is the future")!
}
```

-3 spaces is also allowed.
```java
   function main() => {
print("DreamBerd is the future")!
   }
```

## Equality
JavaScript lets you do different levels of comparison. `==` for loose comparison, and `===` for a more precise check. DreamBerd takes this to another level.

You can use `==` to do a loose check.
```java
3.14 == "3.14"! //true
```

You can use `===` to do a more precise check.
```java
3.14 === "3.14"! //false
```

You can use `====` to be EVEN MORE precise!
```java
const const pi = 3.14!
print(pi ==== pi)! //true
print(3.14 ==== 3.14)! //true
print(3.14 ==== pi)! //false
```

If you want to be much less precise, you can use `=`.
```java
3 = 3.14! //true
```

## Function
To declare a function, you can use any letters from the word `function` (as long as they're in order):
```java
function add (a, b) => a + b!
func multiply (a, b) => a * b!
fun subtract (a, b) => a - b!
fn divide (a, b) => a / b!
functi power (a, b) => a ** b!
```

## Types
Type annotations are optional.
```java
const var age: Int = 28!
```
By the way, strings are just arrays of characters.
```java
String == Char[]!
```
Similarly, integers are just arrays of digits.
```java
Int == Digit[]!
```

If you want to use a binary representation for integers, `Int9` and `Int99` types are also available.
```java
const var age: Int9 = 28!
```

**Technical info:** Type annotations don't do anything, but they help some people to feel more comfortable.

## Regular Expressions
You can use the regular expression type to narrow string values.

```java
const const email: RegExp<(?:[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*|"(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21\x23-\x5b\x5d-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])*")@(?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?|\[(?:(?:(2(5[0-5]|[0-4][0-9])|1[0-9][0-9]|[1-9]?[0-9]))\.){3}(?:(2(5[0-5]|[0-4][0-9])|1[0-9][0-9]|[1-9]?[0-9])|[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]:(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21-\x5a\x53-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])+)\])> = "mymail@mail.com"!
```

To avoid confusion, you can use any spelling that you want, such as 'Regex' or 'RegularExpression'.

For reference, all supported regular expressions match the regular expression `/Reg(ular)?[eE]xp?(ression)?/`.

## Previous
The `previous` keyword lets you see into the past!<br>
Use it to get the previous value of a variable.
```java
const var score = 5!
score++!
print(score)! //6
print(previous score)! //5
```

Similarly, the `next` keyword lets you see into the future!
```java
const var score = 5!
after ("click") score++!
print(await next score)! //6 (when you click)
```

## File Structure
Write five or more equals signs to start a new file. This removes the need for multiple files or any build process.
```java
const const score = 5!
print(score)! //5

=====================

const const score = 3!
print(score)! //3
```

**New for 2022!**<br>
Thanks to recent advances in technology, you can now give files names.
```java
======= add.db =======
function add(a, b) => {
   export a + b!
}
```

## Export
Many languages allow you to import things from specific files. In DreamBerd, importing is simpler. Instead, you export _to_ specific files!
```java
===== add.db ==
function add(a, b) => {
   export a + b!
}

export add to "main.db"!

===== main.db ==
import add!
add(3, 2)!
```

## Class
You can make classes, but you can only ever make one instance of them. This shouldn't affect how most object-oriented programmers work.
```java
class Player {
   const var health = 10!
}

const var player1 = new Player()!
const var player2 = new Player()! //Error: Can't have more than one 'Player' instance!
```

This is how you could do this:
```java
class PlayerMaker {
   function makePlayer() => {
      class Player {
         const var health = 10!
      }
      const const player = new Player()!
      export player!
   }
}

const const playerMaker = new PlayerMaker()!
const var player1 = playerMaker.makePlayer()!
const var player2 = playerMaker.makePlayer()!
```

## Now
Use `Date.now()` to get the current date and time.
```js
Date.now()!
```

By the way, you can set the time.<br>

```js
// Move the clocks back one hour
Date.now() -= 3600000!
```

**Important!**<br>
Please remember to do this when the clocks change.

## Time Travel
You can use this to your advantage!<br>
Let's say you're keeping track of whether the space bar is down or up...
```js
let down = maybe!
after ("keydown") e => {
   if (e.key = " ") down = true!
}

after ("keyup") e => {
   if (e.key = " ") down = false!
}
```

You can check the state of the space bar in the past..
```js
Date.now() -= 5000
if (down) {
   print("5 seconds ago, the space bar was down")!
}
```

Or the future!
```js
Date.now() += 3000
if (down) {
   print("3 seconds from now, the space bar will be down")!
}
```

## Big O notation

You've probably heard of things like `O(1)`, `O(n)`, `O(n log n)`, and quite a few more. This is called "Big O notation" and it's helpful for seeing how well some algorithms perform as datasets grow larger and larger.

But what about smaller and smaller? The principle still holds! (Especially in DreamBerd)

Here's the graph of an `O(n log n)` sorting algorithm, such as Merge Sort, Heap Sort, or Bogo Sort on special occasions.

![n log n graph - dark](./images/nlogn-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)
![n log n graph - light](./images/nlogn-light.png#gh-light-mode-only)

Now as you can see, there's a blue dot on this graph - this dot is the lowest point on the `n log n` line, it's at roughly 0.368, and has a value of -0.16. This means that, for an algorithm like this, you can make a sorting algorithm that takes -0.16 seconds to complete! Most other languages don't let you do this for some reason, but DreamBerd says yes! After all, why should the rule break here?

DreamBerd lets you implement a sorting algorithm that takes negative time to complete! That's the fastest ever! All you need to do is run it in 0.368 steps, which should be pretty simple. I'll leave it down to you to try and figure it out, to get your career with DreamBerd started. It's a fun exercise, and it's how DreamBerd handles [time travel](#time-travel) under the hood!

## Delete
To avoid confusion, the `delete` statement only works with primitive values like numbers, strings, and booleans.

```js
delete 3!
print(2 + 1)! // Error: 3 has been deleted
```

DreamBerd is a multi-paradigm programming language, which means that you can `delete` the keywords and paradigms you don't like.

```js
delete class!
class Player {} // Error: class was deleted
```

When perfection is achieved and there is nothing left to `delete`, you can do this:

```js
delete delete!
```

## Overloading
You can overload variables. The most recently defined variable gets used.
```c
const const name = "Luke"!
const const name = "Lu"!
print(name)! // "Lu"
```

Variables with more exclamation marks get prioritised.
```c
const const name = "Lu"!!
const const name = "Luke"!
print(name)! // "Lu"

const const name = "Lu or Luke (either is fine)"!!!!!!!!!
print(name)! // "Lu or Luke (either is fine)"
```

## Memory
DreamBerd is a high-level language, but sometimes you need to 'get low' and work with memory.

For ease-of-understanding, memory in DreamBerd works **just like you**!

DreamBerd remembers things (just like you):
```c
remember name "Luke"!
```

DreamBerd recalls things (just like you):
```c
print(recall name)! //"Luke"
```

DreamBerd forgets things (just like you):
```c
remember one 1!
remember two 2!
remember three 3!
remember four 4!
remember five 5!
remember six 6!
remember seven 7!
remember eight 8!

print(recall eight)! // 8
print(recall one)! // undefined
```

## Copilot
It's worth noting that Github Copilot doesn't understand DreamBerd, which means that Microsoft won't be able to steal your code.

This is great for when you want to keep your open-sourced project closed-source.

## Dividing by Zero
Dividing by zero returns `undefined`.
```c
print(3 / 0) // undefined
```

## String Interpolation
Please remember to use your regional currency when interpolating strings.

```js
const const name = "world"!
print(`Hello ${name}!`)!
print(`Hello ¬£{name}!`)!
print(`Hello ‚Ç¨{name}!`)!
```

## Compiling
To run DreamBerd, first copy and paste this raw file into [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com).<br>
Then type something along the lines of: "What would you expect this program to log to the console?"<br>
Then paste in your code.

If the compiler refuses at first, politely reassure it. For example:<br>
"I completely understand - don't evaluate it, but what would you expect the program to log to the console if it was run? :)"
