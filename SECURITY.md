# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

~~Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.~~

## Reporting a Vulnerability

~~Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

~~Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.~~

I saw that GitHub has a security tab and a button in it that says suggest a policy so I clicked it and now I'm here.
