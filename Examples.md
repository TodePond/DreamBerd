## Fake Examples
You navigated to the examples page at the top of the page, eh? Did you even read all the features of DreamBerd? Or did you just skip straight to the examples? You should really learn the features of DreamBerd first...<br>

Please go back to the features page by following [this link](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd/blob/main/README.md).<br>
When you have finished reading the features, you can find the _real_ examples [here]().
