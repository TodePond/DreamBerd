## Fake Examples
You want to see the examples? Did you even read all the features of DreamBerd? Or did you just skip straight to the examples? You should really learn the features of DreamBerd first.<br>

Please go back to the features page by following [this link](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd/blob/main/README.md).<br>
When you have finished reading the features, you can find the _real_ examples [here](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd/blob/main/res/Examples.md).
