## New Examples

You want to see the new examples? Did you even read all the new features of DreamBerd 3? Or did you just skip straight to the examples? You should really learn the new features of DreamBerd 3 first.<br>

Please go back to the features page by following [this link](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd/blob/main/README.md).<br>
When you have finished reading the features, you can find the _real_ examples [here](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd/blob/main/res/Examples.md).
